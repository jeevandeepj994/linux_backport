Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in several formats, such as  HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

To build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
Several of them use the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result from upgrading your kernel.
